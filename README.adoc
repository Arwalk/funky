= Funky, functional programming tools for Python

Python's imperative and orient object nature does not always make it easy to adopt a functional programming mindset.

Sure, it does have `map` and `filter` as built-in functions, but it's hardly enough, and relies on keeping intermediate variables to chain easily.

This simple library aims at providing simple tools allowing to chain transformations on iterable objects and maintaining readability at the core of your code.
